# Postmortem: Server Outage - Duration: 20 minutes
 
##  Summary:
-On [25th of november], our server experienced an unplanned outage that lasted for approximately 20 minutes. This incident resulted in a complete loss of service for our users during that period.
### This postmortem aims to provide an analysis of the incident, identify the root cause, and propose preventive measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.
## Root Cause:
### The root cause of the server outage was identified as a network connectivity issue within the hosting provider's infrastructure. A misconfiguration in their network devices caused intermittent packet loss, leading to the unresponsiveness of our server. The issue was resolved by the hosting provider once identified.



## Impact:

- Complete loss of service for all users during the 20-minute outage.
- Financial impact due to potential loss of customer trust and revenue.
- Reputational impact as users experienced a service disruption.


## Mitigation and Preventive Measures:
- To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
- Improved monitoring: Enhance server monitoring capabilities to proactively detect network connectivity issues and server responsiveness.
- Redundancy and failover: Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and minimize the impact of network-related issues.
- Incident response playbook: Develop a comprehensive incident response playbook outlining steps to be taken during server outages, including effective communication channels and escalation procedures.
- Regular infrastructure audits: Conduct regular audits of the hosting provider's infrastructure and network configurations to identify potential misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
- Collaborative relationship with hosting provider: Strengthen collaboration with the hosting provider to ensure timely communication and swift resolution of network-related incidents.
## Lessons Learned:

- Diversify hosting providers: Evaluate the possibility of diversifying our hosting infrastructure across multiple providers to minimize reliance on a single provider.
- Regular testing and drills: Conduct periodic testing and drills of the incident response process to ensure preparedness and identify areas for improvement.
